# 📬 Time Series Forecasting
Predict future values by analyzing patterns in temporal data sequences.

## 📖 Overview

Time Series Forecasting involves analyzing sequential data points ordered by time to identify patterns, trends, seasonality, and make predictions about future values. This critical skill powers applications across finance (stock prediction), operations (demand forecasting), IoT (sensor data), energy (load forecasting), healthcare (disease tracking), and more. Modern forecasting combines classical statistical models (ARIMA, exponential smoothing) with machine learning and deep learning (LSTM, Transformers) for robust, accurate predictions.
