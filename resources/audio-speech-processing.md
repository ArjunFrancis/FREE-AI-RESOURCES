# 🎉 Audio & Speech Processing

Speech recognition (ASR), text-to-speech (TTS), audio analysis, voice synthesis, and speech understanding using machine learning and signal processing techniques.

## 📖 Overview

Audio and speech processing enables machines to understand, generate, and analyze human speech and audio signals. This field combines digital signal processing, linguistics, and deep learning to power applications like voice assistants, transcription services, translation systems, and audio generation tools. From automatic speech recognition to voice cloning, this category covers the full spectrum of speech AI technologies. In 2025-2026, foundation models, emotional TTS, and multilingual systems (120+ languages) are driving the next generation of voice AI.
