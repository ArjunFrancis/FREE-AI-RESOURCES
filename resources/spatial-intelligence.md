# Spatial Intelligence

**Spatial Intelligence** is AI's ability to understand, reason about, and interact with the three-dimensional physical world. This emerging field combines computer vision, robotics, and physics simulation to enable AI systems to perceive depth, spatial relationships, and physical properties—moving beyond 2D understanding to true 3D world comprehension.

## 🎯 Overview

**What is Spatial Intelligence?**

Spatial Intelligence represents AI's next frontier—enabling machines to understand the 3D world as humans do. Unlike traditional AI that processes flat images or text, spatially intelligent systems can:
- Perceive and reason about 3D space
- Understand physical relationships between objects  
- Navigate and manipulate the real world
- Build persistent spatial maps
- Simulate physics and predict outcomes

This technology powers autonomous vehicles, robotics, AR/VR, and the next generation of AI agents that interact with physical environments.
