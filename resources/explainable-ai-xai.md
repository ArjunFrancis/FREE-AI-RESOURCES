# 🔍 Explainable AI (XAI)

Techniques and methods for making machine learning models more transparent, interpretable, and trustworthy through explanation methods and model visualization.

## 📖 Overview

Explainable AI (XAI) focuses on making machine learning and deep learning models more interpretable and understandable to humans. As AI systems become increasingly complex and critical in decision-making, understanding *why* a model makes a prediction is essential for trust, compliance, and debugging. XAI combines model-agnostic and model-specific techniques to illuminate model behavior.
