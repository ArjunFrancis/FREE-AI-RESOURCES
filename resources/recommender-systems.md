# 🎯 Recommender Systems
Build intelligent systems that suggest relevant items to users based on preferences and behavior.

## 📖 Overview

Recommender Systems power personalized experiences across Netflix, Spotify, Amazon, YouTube, and countless other platforms. These systems analyze user preferences, item features, and interaction patterns to predict and recommend relevant content, products, or services. Techniques range from collaborative filtering to deep learning-based approaches, and modern recommenders combine multiple strategies for optimal results.
