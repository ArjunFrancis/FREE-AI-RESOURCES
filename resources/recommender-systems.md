# 🌏 Recommender Systems
Build intelligent systems that suggest relevant items to users based on preferences and behavior.

## 📖 Overview

Recommender Systems power personalized experiences across Netflix, Spotify, Amazon, YouTube, and countless other platforms. These systems analyze user preferences, item features, and interaction patterns to predict and recommend relevant content, products, or services. Modern recommender systems combine collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, and deep learning—with emerging advances leveraging graph neural networks, knowledge graphs, and Large Language Models (LLMs) to enable conversational, agentic, and reasoning-based recommendations. In 2025, LLM-powered agentic recommenders are reshaping the field, enabling multi-step reasoning, dynamic memory, and autonomous agent-based suggestion systems.
