# 🔌 Edge AI & IoT (TinyML & On-Device AI)

Machine learning on resource-constrained embedded devices, IoT platforms, and edge computing systems for real-time, low-latency AI deployment.

## 📖 Overview

Edge AI brings artificial intelligence directly to edge devices—smartphones, IoT sensors, microcontrollers, and embedded systems—enabling real-time inference without cloud connectivity. TinyML (Tiny Machine Learning) focuses on ultra-low-power ML models running on microcontrollers with KB-scale memory, perfect for battery-powered IoT applications.
