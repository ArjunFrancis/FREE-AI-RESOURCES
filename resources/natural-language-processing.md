# Natural Language Processing (NLP)
Techniques and tools for processing and understanding human language, from text preprocessing to advanced transformer-based models and large language models.

## 📖 Overview
Natural Language Processing (NLP) enables computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language. This field combines linguistics, computer science, and machine learning to solve challenges like machine translation, sentiment analysis, question answering, and conversational AI. Modern NLP heavily relies on deep learning architectures, particularly transformers and large language models (LLMs).

**Keywords:** NLP, natural language processing, transformers, BERT, GPT, language models, text classification, named entity recognition, sentiment analysis, machine translation, tokenization, word embeddings

**Skill Levels:** 🟢 Beginner | 🟡 Intermediate | 🔴 Advanced
