# 🌈 Multimodal AI

AI systems that process and integrate multiple types of data (text, images, audio, video) for enhanced understanding, generation, and cross-modal reasoning.

## 📖 Overview

Multimodal AI represents the next frontier in artificial intelligence, enabling systems to understand and generate content across different modalities. These models can process text alongside images, audio, video, and other data types to create more comprehensive AI applications that mirror human multi-sensory perception.
