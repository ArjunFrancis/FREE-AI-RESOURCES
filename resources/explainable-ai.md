# 🔍 Explainable AI (XAI)

Model interpretability, transparency methods, and techniques for understanding and explaining AI decision-making processes for trustworthy and accountable artificial intelligence systems.

## 📖 Overview

Explainable AI (XAI) addresses the critical challenge of understanding how AI systems make decisions. As AI models become more complex and are deployed in high-stakes domains like healthcare, finance, and criminal justice, the ability to explain and interpret their predictions becomes essential for trust, accountability, regulatory compliance, and ethical AI deployment.
