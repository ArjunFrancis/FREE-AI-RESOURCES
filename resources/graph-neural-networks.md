# Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)
Advanced neural network architectures designed for learning from graph-structured data, enabling powerful applications in social networks, molecules, knowledge graphs, and recommendation systems.

## 📖 Overview
Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) extend deep learning to non-Euclidean data structures like graphs and networks. Unlike traditional neural networks that work with grid-structured data (images, text), GNNs can process irregular graph structures where nodes represent entities and edges represent relationships. GNNs have revolutionized fields like drug discovery, social network analysis, traffic prediction, and recommendation systems.
